# ProductManagement
This is a personal project I built just to review what I've learnt about ReactJS and .NET Core
Instruction:
Backend:
- Open ProductManagement.sln
- Set Startup Project as Multiple, choose IdentityServer and ProductManagement as startup projects
- Ctrl F5 to run.
Frontend:
- Enter `npm install` to install necessary packages
- Enter `npm run start` to run the project.
