# ProductManagement
This is a personal project I built just to review what I've learnt about ReactJS and .NET Core
# Instruction:
Backend:
- Use Visual Studio to Open ProductManagement.sln
- Set Startup Project as Multiple, choose IdentityServer and ProductManagement as startup projects
- Ctrl F5 to run.
Frontend: Open folder Frontends with VS Code
- Enter `npm install` to install necessary packages
- Enter `npm run start` to run the project.
